### var reaper = new Reaper()

var Reaper = require('ftp-reap');
var reaper = new Reaper();
```

### reaper.watch(dir)

A FTP connection to reap.

For more details about possible connection properties, look at [ftp#connect() API][ftp-url].

```js
reaper.watch({
    connection: 'n.n.n.n',
    port: 42,
    path: '/path/to/my/files'
});
reaper.watch({
    connection: 'other_host',
    port: 21,
    path: '/path/to/my/other/files'
});

// or

reaper.watch(
    {
        connection: 'n.n.n.n',
        port: 42,
        path: '/path/to/my/files'
    },
    {
        connection: 'other_host',
        port: 21,
        path: '/path/to/my/other/files'
    }
);
```

### reaper.maxAge(ms)

Set the max age based on last modified time for deletion, defaulting to `Infinity`.

You may use `Integer` to specify milliseconds, or human-readable string format like `3 days` or `2 months`.
For more details look at [ms][ms-url] API.

### reaper.run().then( => )

Recursively iterate through directories and delete old files.
Directories structure are preserved.

FTP connections runs in parallel, so you shouldn't see significant perfomance loss.
